Description:

Just a small web app similar to instagram made with Ruby on Rails. I named it "Dalstagram" originally because the name Instagram was already taken, however I had to change it to hmc-cs-dvarney due to guidelines. It features 4 pages; the main page with an all the posts, a signup page, a login page, and a new post page. I've included screenshot of all the functionality in a folder appropriately titled "screenshots."
